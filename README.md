### Challenges with this project  : 
- Learning accessibility, I have been reading about ARIA.
- I'm also trying to adjust font sizes for mobiles. I think I need to use `clamp()` or `calc()` and adapt the `font-size` to the vw, but I didn't spend too much time on it besides reading some documentations. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
