### Challenges with this project  : 
- Learning accessibility, I have been reading about ARIA.
- I'm also trying to figure out how to shrink text on mobile devices only. I think I need to use `clamp()` or `calc()` and adapt the `font-size` to the vw, but I didn't spend too much time on it besides reading some documentations. 
- I'm not sure if I got the `:hover` effect right. I supposed the shadow was expanding when hovering the card component, and the color was changing when hovering the title.  *This could be a good challenge to make them both change when hovering the card, I'm not sure how to do it without using any Javascript*

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
